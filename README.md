# google-homepage
From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css).
In this project, I tried to recreate Google's homepage. I made the page responsive, however, the page may not resemble Google's actual homepage as much on certain devices as it does on others.
